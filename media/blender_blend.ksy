  Blender is an open source suite for 3D modelling, sculpting,
  animation, compositing, rendering, preparation of assets for its own
  game engine and exporting to others, etc. `.blend` is its own binary
  format that saves whole state of suite: current scene, animations,
  all software settings, extensions, etc.

  Internally, .blend format is a hybrid semi-self-descriptive
  format. On top level, it contains a simple header and a sequence of
  file blocks, which more or less follow typical [TLV
  pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-length-value). Pre-last
  block would be a structure with code `DNA1`, which is a essentially
  a machine-readable schema of all other structures used in this file.

      DNA1, also known as "Structure DNA", is a special block in
      .blend file, which contains machine-readable specifications of
      all other structures used in this .blend file.

      Effectively, this block contains:

      * a sequence of "names" (strings which represent field names)
      * a sequence of "types" (strings which represent type name)
      * a sequence of "type lengths"
      * a sequence of "structs" (which describe contents of every
        structure, referring to types and names by index)
