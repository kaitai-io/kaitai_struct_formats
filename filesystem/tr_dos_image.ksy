  .trd file is a raw dump of TR-DOS (ZX-Spectrum) floppy. .trd files are
  headerless and contain consequent "logical tracks", each logical track
  consists of 16 256-byte sectors.

  Logical tracks are defined the same way as used by TR-DOS: for single-side
  floppies it's just a physical track number, for two-side floppies sides are
  interleaved, i.e. logical_track_num = (physical_track_num << 1) | side

  So, this format definition is more for TR-DOS filesystem than for .trd files,
  which are formatless.

  Strings (file names, disk label, disk password) are padded with spaces and use
  ZX Spectrum character set, including UDGs, block drawing chars and Basic
  tokens. ASCII range is mostly standard ASCII, with few characters (^, `, DEL)
  replaced with (up arrow, pound, copyright symbol).

  .trd file can be smaller than actual floppy disk, if last logical tracks are
  empty (contain no file data) they can be omitted.
