  AppleSingle and AppleDouble files are used by certain Mac
  applications (e.g. Finder) to store Mac-specific file attributes on
  filesystems that do not support that.

  Syntactically, both formats are the same, the only difference is how
  they are being used:

  * AppleSingle means that only one file will be created on external
    filesystem that will hold both the data (AKA "data fork" in Apple
    terminology), and the attributes (AKA "resource fork").
  * AppleDouble means that two files will be created: a normal file
    that keeps the data ("data fork") is kept separately from an
    auxiliary file that contains attributes ("resource fork"), which
    is kept with the same name, but starting with an extra dot and
    underscore `._` to keep it hidden.

  In modern practice (Mac OS X), Finder only uses AppleDouble to keep
  compatibility with other OSes, as virtually nobody outside of Mac
  understands how to access data in AppleSingle container.
