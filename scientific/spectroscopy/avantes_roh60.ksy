  Avantes USB spectrometers are supplied with a Windows binary which
  generates one ROH and one RCM file when the user clicks "Save
  experiment". In the version of 6.0, the ROH file contains a header
  of 22 four-byte floats, then the spectrum as a float array and a
  footer of 3 floats. The first and last pixel numbers are specified in the
  header and determine the (length+1) of the spectral data. In the tested
  files, the length is (2032-211-1)=1820 pixels, but Kaitai determines this
  automatically anyway.

  The wavelength calibration is stored as a polynomial with coefficients
  of 'wlintercept', 'wlx1', ... 'wlx4', the argument of which is the
  (pixel number + 1), as found out by comparing with the original
  Avantes converted data files. There is no intensity calibration saved,
  but it is recommended to do it in your program - the CCD in the spectrometer
  is so uneven that one should prepare exact pixel-to-pixel calibration curves
  to get reasonable spectral results.

  The rest of the header floats is not known to the author. Note that the
  newer version of Avantes software has a different format, see also
  <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/37103-avantes-to-matlab>

  The RCM file contains the user-specified comment, so it may be useful
  for automatic conversion of data. You may wish to divide the spectra by
  the integration time before comparing them.
