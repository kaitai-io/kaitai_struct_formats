  Specpr records are fixed format, 1536 bytes/record. Record number
  counting starts at 0. Binary data are in IEEE format real numbers
  and non-byte swapped integers (compatiible with all Sun
  Microsystems, and Hewlett Packard workstations (Intel and some DEC
  machines are byte swapped relative to Suns and HPs). Each record may
  contain different information according to the following scheme.

  You can get some library of spectra from
  ftp://ftpext.cr.usgs.gov/pub/cr/co/denver/speclab/pub/spectral.library/splib06.library/
