  A serialized PHP value, in the format used by PHP's built-in `serialize` and
  `unserialize` functions. This format closely mirrors PHP's data model:
  it supports all of PHP's scalar types (`NULL`, booleans, numbers, strings),
  associative arrays, objects, and recursive data structures using references.
  The only PHP values not supported by this format are *resources*,
  which usually correspond to native file or connection handles and cannot be
  meaningfully serialized.

  There is no official documentation for this data format;
  this spec was created based on the PHP source code and the behavior of
  `serialize`/`unserialize`. PHP makes no guarantees about compatibility of
  serialized data between PHP versions, but in practice, the format has
  remained fully backwards-compatible - values serialized by an older
  PHP version can be unserialized on any newer PHP version.
  This spec supports serialized values from PHP 7.3 or any earlier version.

      doc: |
        An `object` whose class implements a custom serialized format using
        `Serializable`. Available since PHP 5.1.

        default format. Available since PHP 4.
    0x52: # 'R'
      id: variable_reference
      doc: |
        An additional reference to a value that has already appeared earlier.
        Available since PHP 4.0.4.
    0x53: # 'S'
      id: php_6_string
      doc: |
        A `string` value from PHP 6. PHP 6 was never released, but support for
        deserializing PHP 6 strings was added in PHP 5.2.1 and is still present
        as of PHP 7.3. In all versions that support them (other than PHP 6),
        they are deserialized exactly like regular strings.

      id: php_3_object
      doc: |
        An `object` value (without a class name), as serialized by PHP 3.

        PHP 4 through 7.3 included code to deserialize PHP 3 objects,
        which has now been removed from the development repo and will likely
        no longer be included in PHP 7.4. However, apparently this code
        has been broken ever since it was added - it cannot even deserialize
        a simple PHP 3 object like `o:0:{}`. If the code worked, PHP 3 objects
        deserialized under PHP 4 and higher would have the class `stdClass`.
    0x72: # 'r'
      id: object_reference
      doc: |
        An `object` value which shares its identity with another `object`
        that has already appeared earlier. Available since PHP 5.

        doc: |
          The value of the `float`, in ASCII decimal, as generated by PHP's
          usual double-to-string conversion. In particular, this means that:

          * A decimal point may not be included (for integral numbers)
          * The number may use exponent notation (e. g. `1.0E+16`)
          * Positive and negative infinity are represented as `INF`
            and `-INF`, respectively
          * Not-a-number is represented as `NAN`
  length_prefixed_quoted_string:
    doc: |
      A quoted string prefixed with its length.

      Despite the quotes surrounding the string data, it can contain
      arbitrary bytes, which are never escaped in any way.
      This does not cause any ambiguities when parsing - the bounds of
      the string are determined only by the length field, not by the quotes.
