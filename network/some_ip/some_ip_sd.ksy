  The main tasks of the Service Discovery Protocol are communicating the
  availability of functional entities called services in the in-vehicle
  communication as well as controlling the send behavior of event messages.
  This allows sending only event messages to receivers requiring them (Publish/Subscribe).
  The solution described here is also known as SOME/IP-SD
  (Scalable service-Oriented MiddlewarE over IP - Service Discovery).
