        doc: |
          Indicates if the message pair matching was done based on
          replay counter or not.

          Whenever it was set to 1 it means that the replay counter
          was ignored (i.e. it was not considered at all by the
          matching algorithm).

          Hashcat currently does not perform any particular action
          based on this bit, but nonetheless this information could be
          crucial for some 3th party tools and for
          analysis/statistics. There could be some opportunity to
          implement some further logic based on this particular
          information also within hashcat (in the future).
      - id: message_pair
        type: b7
        doc: |
          The message_pair value describes which messages of the 4-way
          handshake were combined to form the .hccapx structure. It is
          always a pair of 2 messages: 1 from the AP (access point)
          and 1 from the STA (client).

          Furthermore, the message_pair value also gives a hint from
          which of the 2 messages the EAPOL origins. This is
          interesting data, but not necessarily needed for hashcat to
          be able to crack the hash.

          On the other hand, it could be very important to know if
          "only" message 1 and message 2 were captured or if for
          instance message 3 and/or message 4 were captured too. If
          message 3 and/or message 4 were captured it should be a hard
          evidence that the connection was established and that the
          password the client used was the correct one.
