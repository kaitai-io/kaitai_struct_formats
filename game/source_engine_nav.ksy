  Base file format used by the Source Engine to store nav mesh data for maps. This KSY file does *not* account for derivative implementations.

  Code for the base NAV file format can be found in `game/server/nav_file.cpp`, which is located in the Source SDK 2013 repository (located at `https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/`).

    doc: |
      Version of the base NAV file format. It is present in all NAV files.

      Changelog over NAV versions:
        * 1 = hiding spots as plain vector array
        * 2 = hiding spots as HidingSpot objects
        * 3 = Encounter spots use HidingSpot ID's instead of storing vector again
        * 4 = Includes size of source bsp file to verify nav data correlation
        * ---- Beta Release at V4 -----
        * 5 = Added Place info
        * ---- Conversion to Source Engine ------
        * 6 = Added Ladder info
        * 7 = Areas store ladder ID's so ladders can have one-way connections
        * 8 = Added earliest occupy times (2 floats) to each area
        * 9 = Promoted CNavArea's attribute flags to a short
        * 10 - Added sub-version number to allow derived classes to have custom area data
        * 11 - Added light intensity to each area
        * 12 - Storing presence of unnamed areas in the PlaceDirectory
        * 13 - Widened NavArea attribute bits from unsigned short to int
        * 14 - Added a bool for if the nav needs analysis
        * 15 - removed approach areas
        * 16 - Added visibility data to the base mesh
