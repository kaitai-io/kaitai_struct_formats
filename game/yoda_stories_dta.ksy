  [Star Wars: Yoda Stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Yoda_Stories) is a unique tile based game with procedurally
  generated worlds.
  This spec describes the file format used for all assets of the Windows
  version of the game.

  The file format follows the TLV (type-length-value) pattern to build a
  central catalog containing the most important (and globally accessible)
  assets of the game (e.g. puzzles, zones, tiles, etc.). The same pattern is
  also found in some catalog entries to encode arrays of variable-length
  structures.

  With every new game, Yoda Stories generates a new world. This is done by
  picking a random sample of puzzles from `PUZ2`. One of the chosen puzzles
  will be the goal, which when solved wins the game.
  Each puzzle provides an item when solved and some require one to be completed.
  During world generation a global world map of 10x10 sectors is filled with
  zones based on the selected puzzles.

  To add variety and interactivity to each zone, the game includes a simple
  scripting engine. Zones can declare actions that when executed can for
  example set, move or delete tiles, drop items or activate enemies.

      This section declares sounds used in the game. The actual audio data is

      Sounds can be referenced from the scripting language (see `play_sound`
      instruction opcode below) and from weapon (see `character` structure).
      Some sound ids (like the one when the hero is hit, or can't leave a

  action:
    doc: |
      Actions are the game's way to make static tile based maps more engaging
      and interactive. Each action consists of zero or more conditions and
      instructions, once all conditions are satisfied, all instructions are
      executed in order.

      To facilitate state, each zone has three 16-bit registers. These registers
      are named `counter`, `shared-counter` and `random`. In addition to these
      registers hidden tiles are sometimes used to mark state.
      There are conditions and instructions to query and update these registers.
      The `shared-counter` register is special in that it is shared between a
      zone and it's rooms. Instruction `0xc` roll_dice can be used to set the
      `random` register to a random value.

      A naive implementation of the scripting engine could look like this:

      ```
      for action in zone.actions:
        all_conditions_satisfied = False
        for condition in action.conditions:
            all_conditions_satisfied = check(condition)
            if not all_conditions_satisfied:
              break

        if !all_conditions_satisfied:
          continue

        for instruction in action.instructions:
          execute(instruction)
      ```

      See `condition_opcode` and `instruction_opcode` enums for a list of
      available opcodes and their meanings.
