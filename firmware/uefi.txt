Table 6. Common UEFI Data Types
BOOLEAN	Logical Boolean. 1-byte value containing a 0 for FALSE or a 1 for  TRUE. Other values are undefined.
INTN	Signed value of native width. (4 bytes on supported 32-bit processor instructions, 8  bytes on supported 64-bit processor instructions)
UINTN	Unsigned value of native width. (4 bytes on supported 32-bit processor instructions, 8 bytes on supported 64-bit processor instructions)
CHAR16	2-byte Character. Unless otherwise specified all characters and strings are stored in the UCS-2 encoding format as defined by Unicode 2.1 and ISO/IEC 10646 standards.
VOID	Undeclared type.
EFI_GUID	128-bit buffer containing a unique identifier value. Unless otherwise specified, aligned on a 64-bit boundary.
EFI_STATUS	Status code. Type UINTN.
EFI_HANDLE	A collection of related interfaces. Type VOID *.
EFI_EVENT	Handle to an event structure. Type VOID *.
EFI_LBA	Logical block address. Type UINT64.
EFI_TPL	Task priority level. Type UINTN.
EFI_MAC_ADDRESS	-byte buffer containing a network Media Access Control address.
EFI_IPv4_ADDRESS   4-byte buffer. An IPv4 internet protocol address. 
EFI_IPv6_ADDRESS   16-byte buffer. An IPv6 internet protocol address.
EFI_IP_ADDRESS	16-byte buffer aligned on a 4-byte boundary. An IPv4 or IPv6 internet protocol address. 
<Enumerated Type> Element of a standard ANSI C enum type declaration. Type INT32.or UINT32. ANSI C does not define the size of sign of an enum so they should never be used in structures. ANSI C integer promotion rules make INT32 or UINT32 interchangeable when passed as an argument to a function.
sizeof (VOID *) 4 bytes on supported 32-bit processor instructions. 8 bytes on supported 64-bit processor instructions.
Bitfields	Bitfields are ordered such that bit 0 is the least significant bit.

Table 7. Modifiers for Common UEFI Data Types
IN	Datum is passed to the function.
OUT	Datum is returned from the function.
OPTIONAL	Passing the datum to the function is optional, and a NULL may be passed if the value is not supplied.
CONST	Datum is read-only.
EFIAPI	Defines the calling convention for UEFI interfaces.
