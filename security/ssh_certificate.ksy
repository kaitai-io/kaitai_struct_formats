          Contains zero or more options that are considered "critical".
          They are considered "critical" as implementations must refuse
          to authorize a certificate that has unrecognized options. This
          prevents an unknown restriction in the certificate from failing to
          be applied.

          The nested type here makes an assumption that the data field will
          either be empty or a single nested "cstring" which is the case for
          all known options today.
      - id: extensions
        type: packed_cstring_tuples_nested
        doc: |
          Contains zero or more optional extensions. These extensions
          are not critical, and an implementation that encounters one
          that it does not recognize may safely ignore it.

          The nested type here makes an assumption that the data field will
          either be empty or a single nested "cstring" which is the case for
          all known extensions today.

          The signature key field contains the CA key used to sign the
          certificate. The valid key types for CA keys are ssh-rsa,
          ssh-dss, ssh-ed25519 and the ECDSA types ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,
          ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, ecdsa-sha2-nistp521. "Chained" certificates, where
          the signature key type is a certificate type itself are NOT supported.
          Note that it is possible for a RSA certificate key to be signed by a
          Ed25519 or ECDSA CA key and vice-versa.

          signature is computed over all preceding fields from the initial string
          up to, and including the signature key. Signatures are computed and
          encoded according to the rules defined for the CA's public key algorithm
          (RFC4253 section 6.6 for ssh-rsa and ssh-dss, RFC5656 for the ECDSA
          types), and draft-josefsson-eddsa-ed25519-03 for Ed25519.

    doc: |
      Arbitrary length binary string. Strings are allowed to contain
      arbitrary binary data, including null characters and 8-bit
      characters. They are stored as a uint32 containing its length
      (number of bytes that follow) and zero (= empty string) or more
      bytes that are the value of the string. Terminating null
      characters are not used.

      Strings are also used to store text. In that case, US-ASCII is
      used for internal names, and ISO-10646 UTF-8 for text that might
      be displayed to the user. The terminating null character SHOULD
      NOT normally be stored in the string. For example: the US-ASCII
      string "testing" is represented as 00 00 00 07 t e s t i n g. The
      UTF-8 mapping does not alter the encoding of US-ASCII characters.
