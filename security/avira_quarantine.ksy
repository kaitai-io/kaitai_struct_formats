  Avira quarantine files are created by the Avira Antivirus software.
  They store suspected malware and its metadata, usually under /ProgramData/Avira/Antivirus/INFECTED. The file extension usually is .qua.
  The parser was created by analyzing different quarantine files.
  Avira qurantine files consist of an unencrypted metadata part and the encrypted suspected malware.
