  A phar (PHP archive) file. The phar format is a custom archive format
  from the PHP ecosystem that is used to package a complete PHP library
  or application into a single self-contained archive.
  All phar archives start with an executable PHP stub, which can be used to
  allow executing or including phar files as if they were regular PHP scripts.
  PHP 5.3 and later include the phar extension, which adds native support for
  reading and manipulating phar files.

  The phar format was originally developed as part of the PEAR library
  PHP_Archive, first released in 2005. Later, a native PHP extension
  named "phar" was developed, which was first released on PECL in 2007,
  and is included with PHP 5.3 and later. The phar extension has effectively
  superseded the PHP_Archive library, which has not been updated since 2010.
  The phar extension is also no longer released independently on PECL;
  it is now developed and released as part of PHP itself.

  Because of current limitations in Kaitai Struct
  (seekaitai-io/kaitai_struct#158 and kaitai-io/kaitai_struct#538),
  the executable PHP stub that precedes the rest of the archive is not handled
  by this spec. Before parsing a phar using this spec, the stub must be
  removed manually.

  A phar's stub is terminated by the special token `__HALT_COMPILER();`
  (which may be followed by at most one space, the PHP tag end `?>`,
  and an optional line terminator). The stub termination sequence is
  immediately followed by the remaining parts of the phar format,
  as described in this spec.

  The phar stub usually contains code that loads the phar and runs
  a contained PHP file, but this is not required. A minimal valid phar stub
  is `<?php __HALT_COMPILER();` - such a stub makes it impossible to execute
  the phar directly, but still allows loading or manipulating it using the
  phar extension.

  Note: The phar format does not specify any encoding for text fields
  (stub, alias name, and all file names), so these fields may contain arbitrary
  binary data. The actual text encoding used in a specific phar file usually
  depends on the application that created the phar, and on the
  standard encoding of the system on which the phar was created.

      Note: Almost all of the available "signature" types are actually hashes,
      not signatures, and cannot be used to verify that the archive has not
      been tampered with. Only the OpenSSL signature type is a true

      A phar API version number. This version number is meant to indicate
      which features are used in a specific phar, so that tools reading
      the phar can easily check that they support all necessary features.

      The following API versions exist so far:

      * 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.7.1: The first official API versions. At this point,
        the phar format was only used by the PHP_Archive library, and the
        API version numbers were identical to the PHP_Archive versions that
        supported them. Development of the native phar extension started around
        API version 0.7. These API versions could only be queried using the
        `PHP_Archive::APIversion()` method, but were not stored physically
        in archives. These API versions are not supported by this spec.
      * 0.8.0: Used by PHP_Archive 0.8.0 (released 2006-07-18) and
        later development versions of the phar extension. This is the first
        version number to be physically stored in archives. This API version
        is not supported by this spec.
      * 0.9.0: Used by later development/early beta versions of the
        phar extension. Also temporarily used by PHP_Archive 0.9.0
        (released 2006-12-15), but reverted back to API version 0.8.0 in
        PHP_Archive 0.9.1 (released 2007-01-05).
      * 1.0.0: Supported since PHP_Archive 0.10.0 (released 2007-05-29)
        and phar extension 1.0.0 (released 2007-03-28). This is the first
        stable, forwards-compatible and documented version of the format.
      * 1.1.0: Supported since PHP_Archive 0.12.0 (released 2015-07-06)
        and phar extension 1.1.0 (released 2007-04-12). Adds SHA-256 and
        SHA-512 signature types.
      * 1.1.1: Supported since phar extension 2.0.0 (released 2009-07-29 and
        included with PHP 5.3 and later). (PHP_Archive 0.12.0 also supports
        all features from API verison 1.1.1, but it reports API version 1.1.0.)
        Adds the OpenSSL signature type and support for storing
        empty directories.
