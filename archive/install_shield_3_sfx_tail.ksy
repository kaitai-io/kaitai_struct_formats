  The data format used in InstallShield 3 self-extracting installers.
  These installers start with a normal Microsoft PE executable,
  which is directly followed by the data in this format.

  This is only a very thin wrapper around ZIP files.
  These ZIP files can also be carved from the installer
  using a program that can search for ZIP data embedded in a file,
  such as 7-Zip in "parser mode" (type `#`) or Binwalk.

          Path name for this file,
          encrypted using a relatively simple algorithm.
          The path name can be decrypted bytewise using the formula
          `byte_rot_right((path_encrypted[i] ^ path_encryption_key[7-(i%8)]), 7-(i%8)) ^ path_encryption_key[i%8]`,
          where `i` is the (0-based) index of the byte in question.

          The zipped file.
          The data should be a ZIP archive containing exactly one file
          which should be located at top level
          and whose name should match the one stored in path_encrypted
          (without any leading directories).
