  The Unix pack compression format, a very basic compression format based on
  Huffman coding. The Unix `pack` utility could compress files into
  this format, and could be decompressed using the utilities `unpack`
  and `pcat`.
  
  The pack format is long obsolete - it was superseded in the 1980s
  by the LZW-based compression format of `compress` (which is itself
  almost never used anymore on modern Unix derivatives). Despite this,
  the `gzip` utility still supports decompressing (but not compressing)
  data in the pack compression format.

      The compressed data. This is a sequence of Huffman codes (variable-length
      bit sequences) stored in most-significant bit first order without any
      padding/alignment between individual codes. If the coded data does not
      end on a byte boundary, it is padded with zeroes at the end (i. e. in the
      least significant bits).

  tree:
    doc: |
      Serialized representation of a binary Huffman tree. The tree always
      follows these rules:
      
      * The tree is always left-aligned, i. e. on each level of the tree,
        all inner (non-leaf) nodes are on the left side of the tree,
        and all leaves are on the right side.
      * The total number of nodes on each tree level is two times the number
        of inner nodes on the previous level (since this is a binary tree,
        each inner node has exactly two children).
      * There is a single implicit root node.
      * The number of inner nodes on each tree level can be calculated from
        the total number of nodes and the number of leaf nodes.
      * The rightmost leaf on the last level of the tree always stands for EOF,
        and is not stored explicitly in the file (unlike all other
        leaf values).

          The number of leaves on each level of the tree.
          
          Note: the last leaf count is stored *minus two*. However, the last
          leaf always stands for EOF and does not have an associated
          byte value, so for the purposes of parsing this format, the last
          level's leaf count is considered *minus one*.
