  # The ar format is somewhat unusual: although it can store arbitrary data files, the ar format itself is text-based - all fields and magic numbers are pure ASCII.
  # In particular, numerical values are stored as ASCII-encoded decimal and octal numbers, rather than packed byte values.  Because of this, the ar format has no endianness.
  # No string encoding is specified either. As different systems use different encodings, all text (i. e. file names) are exposed as byte arrays.

  The Unix ar archive format, as created by the `ar` utility. It is a simple uncompressed flat archive format, but is rarely used for general-purpose archiving. Instead, it is commonly used by linkers to collect multiple object files along with a symbol table into a static library. The Debian package format (.deb) is also based on the ar format.
  
  The ar format is not standardized and several variants have been developed, which differ mainly in how member names and the symbol table (if any) are stored. This specification describes the basic structure shared by all ar variants.

        doc: |
          The name of the archive member, right-padded with spaces. Because the exact format of this field differs between format variants, it is exposed as a fixed-size byte array. Long member names are not processed, and no terminator or padding characters are removed. To read member names correctly from an archive whose format variant is known, use the `ar_bsd` or `ar_sysv` specification.
          
          Names are usually unique within an archive, but this is not required - the `ar` command even provides various options to work with archives containing multiple identically named members.
