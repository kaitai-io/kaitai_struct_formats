  The System V variant of the Unix ar archive format (see the `ar_generic` spec for general info about the ar format). This variant is also used on Linux and Windows systems.
  
  System V archives support member names that contain spaces by terminating the name field using a slash instead of a space. File names longer than 16 bytes are supported by storing the name in a special archive member called "//" and only storing a byte offset in the member name field.

    doc: |
      The index of the special "long name list" member in the members array, or `-1` if this archive doesn't contain a long name list.
      
      Note: the long name list is only recognized if it is one of the first three archive members. This is because it it always appears immediately after the symbol table (or if there is no symbol table, at the very beginning of the archive). Windows archives can contain two symbol table members, so the long name list can be at most the third member.
  long_name_list:
    value: members[long_name_list_index]
    if: long_name_list_index != -1
    doc: A special archive member that holds a list of long names used by other archive members. (Optional, only present if the archive has members with long names.)

    doc: A "special" member name that does not follow the usual format. This kind of name is used for special members that do not represent a normal file, such as the symbol table (named "/", or on 64-bit Solaris "/SYM64/") and the long name list (named "//").

    doc: Dummy type representing a member's data. This type is used instead of a normal byte array to allow "looking into" it using instances (this is needed to handle long member names).

        doc: An extra newline is added as padding after members with an odd data size. This ensures that all members are 2-byte-aligned.

        doc: |
          The name of the archive member. Because the encoding of member names varies across systems, the name is exposed as a byte array.
          
          Names are usually unique within an archive, but this is not required - the `ar` command even provides various options to work with archives containing multiple identically named members.
      size:
        value: size_raw.value
        doc: The size of the member's data. The trailing padding byte (if any) does not count toward the data size.
      data:
        value: data_internal.data
        doc: The member's data.
    doc: An archive member's header and data.
