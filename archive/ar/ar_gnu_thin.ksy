  The thin ar archive format, as created by the GNU binutils `ar` utility using the `T` flag. Thin archives are used by GNU binutils as a more efficient format for locally-created static libraries than the regular ar format. Thin archives only store the paths of all contained files (relative to the archive), but not the files' actual data - to read data from the archive, the original files need to be looked up and read. This makes thin archives unsuitable for general-purpose archiving (in fact, GNU `ar` does not support manually extracting thin archives), they are only meant to be used as a static library format.
  
  The internal structure of thin archives is very similar to regular System V/GNU ar archives, but the formats are not compatible.

    doc: |
      The index of the special "long name list" member in the members array, or `-1` if this archive doesn't contain a long name list.
      
      Note: the long name list is only recognized if it is one of the first two archive members. This is because it it always appears immediately after the symbol table (or if there is no symbol table, at the very beginning of the archive).
  long_name_list:
    value: members[long_name_list_index]
    if: long_name_list_index != -1
    doc: A special archive member that holds a list of long names used by other archive members. (Optional, only present if the archive has members with long names.)

        # The terminator is actually a slash followed by a newline, but multi-character terminators are not supported by Kaitai, and it's very unlikely that a path will contain a newline.
        terminator: 0x0a
        doc: The member name (actually a relative path) stored in the long name list, terminated by a slash and a newline. For technical reasons, includes the terminating slash (but not the newline).
    doc: A long member name (actually a relative path), stored as a reference into the long name list.

        doc: The member name, as a byte array, right-padded using ASCII spaces.
    doc: A "special" member name that does not follow the usual format. This kind of name is used for special members that do not represent a normal file, such as the symbol table (named "/") and the long name list (named "//").
  member_name:

    doc: Dummy type representing a member's data. This type is used instead of a normal byte array to allow "looking into" it using instances (this is needed to handle long member names).

        doc: An extra newline is added as padding after members with an odd data size. This ensures that all members are 2-byte-aligned.

        doc: |
          The name of the archive member. Because the encoding of member names varies across systems, the name is exposed as a byte array.
          
          Names are usually unique within an archive, but this is not required - the `ar` command even provides various options to work with archives containing multiple identically named members.
      size:
        value: size_raw.value
        doc: The size of the member's data. The trailing padding byte (if any) does not count toward the data size.
      data:
        value: data_internal.data
        if: not name_internal.is_long
        doc: The member's data. Only present for special members.
    doc: An archive member's header and data.
