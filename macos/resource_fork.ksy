  The data format of Macintosh resource forks,
  used on Classic Mac OS and Mac OS X/macOS to store additional structured data along with a file's main data (the data fork).
  The kinds of data stored in resource forks include:

  * Document resources:
    images, sounds, etc. used by a document
  * Application resources:
    graphics, GUI layouts, localizable strings,
    and even code used by an application, a library, or system files
  * Common metadata:
    custom icons and version metadata that could be displayed by the Finder
  * Application-specific metadata:
    because resource forks follow a common format,
    other applications can store new metadata in them,
    even if the original application does not recognize or understand it

  Macintosh file systems (MFS, HFS, HFS+, APFS) support resource forks natively,
  which allows storing resources along with any file.
  Non-Macintosh file systems and protocols have little or no support for resource forks,
  so the resource fork data must be stored in some other way when using such file systems or protocols.
  Various file formats and tools exist for this purpose,
  such as BinHex, MacBinary, AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or QuickTime RezWack.
  In some cases,
  resource forks are stored as plain data in separate files with a .rsrc extension,
  even on Mac systems that natively support resource forks.

  On modern Mac OS X/macOS systems,
  resource forks are used far less commonly than on classic Mac OS systems,
  because of compatibility issues with other systems and historical limitations in the format.
  Modern macOS APIs and libraries do not use resource forks,
  and the legacy Carbon API that still used them has been deprecated since OS X 10.8.
  Despite this,
  even current macOS systems still use resource forks for certain purposes,
  such as custom file icons.

      System-reserved data area.
      This field can generally be ignored when reading and writing.

      This field is used by the Classic Mac OS Finder as temporary storage space.
      It usually contains parts of the file metadata (name, type/creator code, etc.).
      Any existing data in this field is ignored and overwritten.

      Application-specific data area.
      This field can generally be ignored when reading and writing.

      According to early revisions of Inside Macintosh,
      this field is "available for application data".
      In practice, it is almost never used for this purpose,
      and usually contains only junk data.

      In resource files written by Mac OS X,
      this field is set to all zero bytes.

      Storage area for the data blocks of all resources.

      These data blocks are not required to appear in any particular order,
      and there may be unused space between and around them.

      In practice,
      the data blocks in newly created resource files are usually contiguous.
      When existing resources are shortened,
      the Mac OS resource manager leaves unused space where the now removed resource data was,
      as this is quicker than moving the following resource data into the newly freed space.
      Such unused space may be cleaned up later when the resource manager "compacts" the resource file,
      which happens when resources are removed entirely,
      or when resources are added or grown so that more space is needed in the data area.

          the start of the resource reference list area is not stored explicitly in the file,

                          Indicates that this resource reference is a system reference rather than a regular local reference.
                          This attribute is nearly undocumented.
                          For all practical purposes,
                          it should be considered reserved and should always be zero.

                          This attribute was last documented in the Promotional Edition of Inside Macintosh,
                          in the Resource Manager chapter,
                          on pages 37-41,
                          in a "System References" section that calls itself "of historical interest only".
                          The final versions of Inside Macintosh only mention this attribute as "reserved for use by the Resource Manager".
                          <CarbonCore/Resources.h> contains a `resSysRefBit` constant,
                          but no corresponding `resSysRef` constant like for all other resource attributes.

                          According to the Inside Macintosh Promotional Edition,
                          a system reference was effectively an alias pointing to a resource stored in the system file,
                          possibly with a different ID and name (but not type) than the system reference.
                          If this attribute is set,
                          `ofs_data_block` is ignored and should be zero,
                          and `reserved_handle` contains
                          (in its high and low two bytes, respectively)
                          the ID and name offset of the real system resource that this system reference points to.

                          TODO Do any publicly available Mac OS versions support system references,
                          and do any real files/applications use them?
                          So far the answer seems to be no,
                          but I would like to be proven wrong!

                          rather than the application heap.

                          This attribute is only meant to be used by Mac OS itself,
                          for System and Finder resources,
                          and not by normal applications.

                          This attribute may be set both in memory and on disk,
                          but it only has any meaning while the resource file is loaded into memory.

                          Indicates that this resource's data should be purgeable by the Mac OS Memory Manager.
                          This allows the resource data to be purged from memory if space is needed on the heap.
                          Purged resources can later be reloaded from disk if their data is needed again.

                          If the `locked` attribute is set,
                          this attribute has no effect
                          (i. e. locked resources are never purgeable).

                          This attribute may be set both in memory and on disk,

                          This prevents the resource data from being moved when the heap is compacted.

                          Indicates that this resource should be protected (i. e. unmodifiable) in memory.
                          This prevents the application from using the Resource Manager to change the resource's data or metadata,
                          or delete it.
                          The only exception are the resource's attributes,
                          which can always be changed,
                          even for protected resources.
                          This allows protected resources to be unprotected again by the application.

                          This attribute is only meant to be set in memory;
                          it is cleared when the resource file is written to disk.

                          This attribute is used internally by the Resource Manager and should not be set manually by the application.

                          Compressed resource data is decompressed transparently by the Resource Manager when reading.

              The resource name.

              This field is exposed as a byte array,
              because there is no universal encoding for resource names.
              Most Classic Mac software does not deal with encodings explicitly and instead assumes that all strings,
              including resource names,
              use the system encoding,
              which varies depending on the system language.
              This means that resource names can use different encodings depending on what system language they were created with.

              Many resource names are plain ASCII,
              meaning that the encoding often does not matter
              (because all Mac OS encodings are ASCII-compatible).
              For non-ASCII resource names,
              the most common encoding is perhaps MacRoman
              (used for English and other Western languages),
              but other encodings are also sometimes used,
              especially for software in non-Western languages.

              There is no requirement that all names in a single resource file use the same encoding.
              For example,
              localized software may have some (but not all) of its resource names translated.
              For non-Western languages,
              this can lead to some resource names using MacRoman,
              and others using a different encoding.
